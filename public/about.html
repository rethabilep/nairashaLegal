<p>
    Nairasha is Masaai word for “discover”, a new thing, or an unexpected find. Nairasha is the daughter of the founder
    of Nairasha Legal support founding director Adv. Lineo Tsikoane. Adv. Tsikoane is an admitted advocate of the High
    Court of Lesotho and a renown Human rights activist with a deep passion for equality and social justice. This
    Lesotho born lawyer and activist obtained her LLB (Hons) degree from the National University of Lesotho and an LLM
    from the University of York, in the United Kingdom.
    <br>
    She has over fourteen years work experience in the fields of development, legal compliance, strategic
    litigation and social justice advocacy across different fields but with particular focus on vulnerable groups,
    LGBTI+ community, women, children and communities affected by development.
    <br>
    She has experience working and living in three continents, but her grounding passion is on inclusion and meaningful
    empowerment of women in Africa. A Mandela Washington Fellow, Chevenning Scholar and Mount Holyoke Leadership and
    Social Action alum, Adv. Tsikoane believes it is meaningless to talk of empowerment without addressing financial
    empowerment.
    <br>
    She therefore has turned this chapter of her life to ensuring that meaningful empowerment is achieved by creating a
    conducive environment and support for small businesses to thrive. Adv. Tsikoane is married to a Kenyan-born
    clinician and is a mother of two boys and an only daughter Nairasha. She is loves reading, poetry and travelling
    with her family.
